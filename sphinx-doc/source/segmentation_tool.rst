This page explains the steps necessary to setup volumetric segmentation in CATMAID using preprocessed data with SOPNET.

Admin
^^^^^

* In the Django admin interface, create a SliceInfo instance for the stack you generated slices for. I.e. setup
slice base url (the path to the slice images as visible from the web)
slice base path (the local path on the file system)
file extension (e.g. png)

* Using the `Ontology Editor` make sure that in your project there exists as class named `assembly`.

* If you test with a slice base url pointing to localhost, you might have to start Chrome with the option `--disable-web-security` to allow cross-origin data access.

* You need to insert the data generated by SOPNET into the CATMAID database. TODO: How?
